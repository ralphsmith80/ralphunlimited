I still enjoy making games and I was very interested in playing with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/ "Phaser"). Here’s a simple game I threw together using phaser. The embedded demo is below. If you’d rather play the game in full browser window you can do so [here](/games/retro-cruiser "Retro Cruiser!"). Enjoy!

Instructions:

-   Spacebar: shoot
-   Arrows: move
-   Controls on Mobile: virtual onscreen controls
-   Health is yellow/gold bar on the left
    -   Grab some health power ups to recover health
-   Fuel is blue bar on the right
    -   Fuel will be used up faster while you move so make sure you grab some blue fuel power ups when they drop or you’ll fall out of the sky!
-   Other power up include more powerful weapons

NOW BLAST THOSE ASTEROIDS CAPTAIN!!
