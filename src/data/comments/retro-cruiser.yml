    Thanks! I ran across the basic game idea on some  how to build a game  web
    page. Wish I could find the link. Anyway, that lead me to this page where
    you can download most of the graphics I used.

    I ve done my own rudimentary graphics in the past. It can be very time
    consuming and I was mostly interested in just playing with Phaser.

    I typically make my projects available on Github, but I m not ready to make
    this available to the public yet. Maybe someday in the future though. If you
    a have specific question feel free to post it and I ll help you out if I
    know the answer.

    For a basic Phaser game like this one you can get pretty far just going off
    one of their examples. That s exactly how I started.
